        "Jaxtyping also gives us useful type hint features, e.g. we have `ray: Float[Tensor, \"points dims\"]` to indicate a tensor of floats with dimensions `points` and `dims`. Unlike the examples above this is unlikely to be captured by syntax highlighting when you make a mistake, instead it's best to view this as an alternative to annotating the tensor shape. You may or may not prefer to use this.\n",

        "When in doubt however, it's best to make assertions on the variable type or tensor shape explicitly, e.g. `assert isinstance(x, Tensor)` or `assert x.shape == ...`.

Analogously, we use the operators `&`, `|` `~` on tensors to perform these operations on each element of the tensor, e.g. `x & y` returns the tensor with elements `x[i] and y[i]`.\n",

For instance, `v >= 0 & v <= 1` will actually throw an error because it's evaluated as actually evaluated as `(v >= (0 & v)) <= 1` (because `&` has high precedence) and `0 & v` is not a valid operation. When in doubt, use parentheses to force the correct parsing: `(v >= 0) & (v <= 1)`."

        "You can debug a cell by clicking on the **Debug cell** option at the bottom of your cell. Your cell should contain the code that is actually run to cause an error (rather than needing to contain the function which is the source of the error). Before you run your debugger, you can set breakpoints by clicking on the left-hand side of the line number (a red dot will appear). You can then step through your code, using the toolbar of buttons which will appear when you run the debugger (see [here](https://pawelgrzybek.com/continue-step-over-step-into-and-step-out-actions-in-visual-studio-code-debugger-explained/) for an explanation of what each of the buttons does). When you reach a breakpoint, you can use the following tools:\n",

        "* Add variables expressions to watch, in the **WATCH** window that appears on the left sidebar.\n",

        "\n",
        "Note, when you run the debugger, it will stop *before* the breakpoint line is evaluated. So if you've run a cell and got an error on a specific line, then *that* is the line you want to set a breakpoint on.\n",
        "\n",
        "*This all works basically the same if you're in a notebook in VSCode, except for a few changes e.g. the debug button is on the dropdown at the top-left of the cell (if it doesn't appear for you then you'll need to go into user settings and add the line `\"notebook.consolidatedRunButton\": true`).*\n",
