# AISI-Rapid-Upskilling
Application notebooks for AISI Rapid Upskilling Cohorts :)

I attempted and completed all sections of the assigned tasks (including the optional sections, which is partly why I've taken my time for my submission!) and through working through each example and struggling with the code, I've gotten a relatively strong grasp on many of the topics presented throughout the notebooks.

All of my work was completed on google colab, and my solution notebooks are all files in the github with links to the original colab where I edited each of the files. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the application process - it really pushed me to go beyond my conceptual understanding and dig deep into the source code, and the content has sparked my curiosity to keep learning more. Excited to keep digging deeper!!
