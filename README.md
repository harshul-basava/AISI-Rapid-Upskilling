# AISI-Rapid-Upskilling
Application notebooks for AISI Rapid Upskilling Cohorts :)

I attempted and completed all sections of the assigned tasks (including the optional sections, which is partly why I've taken my time for my submission!) and through working through each example and struggling with the code, I've gotten a relatively strong grasp on many of the topics presented throughout the notebooks.

All of my work was completed on google colab, and my solution notebooks are all files in the github with links to the original colab where I edited each of the files. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the application process - it really pushed me to go beyond my conceptual understanding and dig deep into the source code, and the content has sparked my curiosity to keep learning more. Excited to keep digging deeper!!

# Update - I was accepted!

From now on, this github repository stores all of the work I do as part of the Rapid Upskilling Cohorts, and my own solutions to the ARENA curriculum. Excited to keep learning more!
